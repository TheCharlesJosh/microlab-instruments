This will be the unofficial documentation of the Kyle and Charles codes.

Two main files:
| oscui.py 	(Handling the Oscilloscope)
| precision.py	(Handling the Power Sources)

At the very least, they work well.

CHANGELOG: Power Sources
	* Can now set to a constant voltage source with current compliance
	* Can now fetch current flowing through the system
CHANGELOG: Oscilloscope
	* Can now plot the points nice and smoothly
	* Can grab both the frequency and the peak-to-peak voltages
	* Can get the data one by one
CHANGELOG: Overall
	* Find a way to present data in SI prefix


TODO: Power Sources
	* (Cool kung kaya) Create a signal generator
TODO: Oscilloscope
	* Dump the image to the computer and automatically open the file
	* Support error detection for 'no edges'.
	* Specifically the measure:results? and measure:statistics?
	* Also clear the goddamn buffer
TODO: Overall
	* Read the manual again.
